    Based on your selection of lunch choices, I can see that this is generally a healthy diet. If you are above the age of 50, I would stay away from burgers and mac anc cheese since they are high in calories and cholesterol.  I would say that sandwiches are good choices but make sure that they are healthy options. No FAST FOOD!
